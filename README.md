# ü§ñ GAIA Agent ‚Äì Hugging Face AI Agents Course Final Project

Welcome to the final assignment of the Hugging Face AI Agents Course! This
repository contains a custom-built AI agent evaluated on the GAIA benchmark ‚Äî
a rigorous test designed to challenge AI assistants on real-world, multi-step
tasks.

## üåç Introduction to the GAIA Benchmark

GAIA is a comprehensive benchmark of **466 real-world, multi-step factoid questions**
designed to evaluate an AI assistant‚Äôs ability to reason, browse the web,
handle multimodal inputs, and leverage external tools in zero-shot settings.
Unlike traditional benchmarks, GAIA tasks remain conceptually simple for humans
(‚âà92 % human accuracy) yet challenge even state-of-the-art models augmented
with plugins (‚âà15 % accuracy for GPT-4).

#### GAIA‚Äôs Core Principles
- **Real-world difficulty**: Requires multi-hop retrieval, web scraping, PDF/image parsing, etc.  
- **Human interpretability**: Tasks are easy to validate via concise, unambiguous answers.  
- **Non-gameability**: Brute forcing is ineffective‚Äîcomplete tool chains are needed.  
- **Simplicity of evaluation**: Unique factoid answers allow for automatic scoring.

### üéì Course Context: HuggingFace AI Agents Final Project

This agent is the **capstone** of the HuggingFace AI Agents course‚Äôs final unit.  
- **Goal**: Build an agent that uses multiple tools to answer GAIA questions zero-shot.  
- **Certification**: Score **‚â• 30 %** (i.e., **6/20** correct) on a held-out set of 20 GAIA questions to earn your course certificate.  
- **Leaderboard**: Submit your score to the student leaderboard to compare with peers.

> **Heads Up**: This practical unit demands advanced coding and problem-solving with minimal hand-holding.
